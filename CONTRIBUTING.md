# How to contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Check out the source

Do the following to check out the GAPID source code on GitHub:

1.  Sign up for GitHub at https://github.com/ if you donâ€™t already have an account.
1.  (Optional) Set up an SSH key to [connect to your account using SSH].
1.  (Optional) [Add a GPG signing key to your account].
1.  Go to the project landing page at https://github.com/google/gapid.
1.  [Fork the repository]. This creates a copy of the repository in your account.
1.  Create a work folder on your workstation. The rest of this document assumes `~/work`, adjust as needed.
1.  On _your_ GAPID project page, [clone your copy of the repository] and add it to your local work folder:
    ```
    cd ~/work
    git clone <clone-url>
    cd gapid
    ```
1.  Add the Google remote repository to your local repository:
    ```
    git remote add goog git@github.com:google/gapid.git
    git fetch goog
    ```

## (Optional) Configure git

Use the following commands to configure git for GAPID development:
```
# Assume the remote branch has the same name as your local branch to make pushing changes easier
git config push.default current 
# Default to pushing to your fork (assuming the above directions)
git config remote.pushDefault origin
# Make git clean up all the remote tags it creates when you delete remote branches
git config fetch.prune true
git config user.name <your-name> # Add --global to make this a global setting
git config user.email <you@your-email.com> # Can also be a global setting
# If you added a GPG signing key, run the following commands:
git config user.signingkey <keyid> 
git config commit.gpgsign true
```

## Build GAPID for the first time

Follow the [build instructions] in the GAPID repository.

## Open a pull request (PR)

Do the following to contribute to the GAPID project:

1.  Prepare your changes on a dedicated branch in your local repository:
    ```
    git checkout -b <my-branch>
    ```  
1.  Make changes, commit the changes, and squash them into a single commit. 
1.  Use the presubmit script to check code formatting and other things:
    ```
    # Install clang-format 6.0 
    sudo apt-get install -y clang-format-6.0 
    export CLANG_FORMAT=clang-format-6.0
    # Run the script
    ./kokoro/presubmit/presubmit.sh
    ```
1.  Fix potential issues, commit the fix, squash into a single commit again.
1.  Re-run presubmit script until it passes without warnings.
1.  Check that the tests pass:
    ```
    bazel test tests
    ```
1.  Push to your GitHub repo:
    ```
    git push 
    ```
1.  Visit https://github.com/google/gapid to see a pop-up dialog inviting you  to open a PR; click on the dialog to create a PR. See [Creating a pull request from a fork] for more information.
