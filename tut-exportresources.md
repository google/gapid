GAPID provides the ability to export geometry and texture data from your trace.

## Geometry

After finding the appropriate draw call in the Geometry pane, you can click the `Save model as OBJ` button to export the model to the [OBJ format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file). 

## Texture

In the Textures pane, find the appropriate resource and then click `Save image to file` icon to export the texture in PNG format.
