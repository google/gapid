package reporting

// This file contains stub implementations of the reporting package (used when
// the crashreporting build tag is omitted).
//
// As cmd/do references this package, be very careful not to pull in imports
// that cannot be built with do. For example anything that uses protobufs.

import "context"

// Enable turns on crash reporting if the running processes panics inside a
// crash.Go block.
func Enable(ctx context.Context, appName, appVersion string) {}
