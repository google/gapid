# LUCI Python Client

This is the Python Client code for LUCI. It's part of the [main python
repo][1], and is also mirrored into a standalone [client-py repo][2].

To contribute changes you need to clone the [main python repo][1] and then
use git cl upload. The [client-py repo][2] mirror (which appears in Chromium's
third_party directory) cannot be contributed to directly.
