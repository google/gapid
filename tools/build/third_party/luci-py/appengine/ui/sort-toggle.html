    <sort-toggle>

  Sort-toggle is a small ui widget that can be tapped to change the way
  something is sorted.  The preferred way to use this is to have multipe
  of them created in dom-repeat.  The parent then listens to the
  sort_change event and sets the current property on all the sort-toggles
  to keep them up to date.

  Only one sort-toggle will be active in this way.

  Properties:
    // input
    current: Object, the current sort-toggle that should be active. Is
        The same format as the event.detail Object.
    name: String, the name of the thing being sorted. To be used in the
        fired event.

    // output
    direction: String, the direction of the sorting.  "asc", "", "desc" for
        ascending/nothing/descending.



  Methods:
    None.

  Events:
    sort_change: when a user has tapped this element.  The details includes
        name and direction.
