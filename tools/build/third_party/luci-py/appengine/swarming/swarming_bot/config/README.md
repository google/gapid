# Server injected configuration files

This directory contains all the files that will be overridden by the server.
The ones in this location are the default ones, and are typically only used
when creating a fake swarming_bot.zip file via the
appengine/swarming/tools/bot_archive.py script.

*   [bootstrap.py](bootstrap.py) is served off /bootstrap endpoint. It is user
    configurable but entirely optional.
*   [bot_config.py](bot_config.py) is included in swarming_bot.zip. It is user
    configurable and is expected to be modified to suit the project's bot
    management.
*   [config.json](config.json) is generated by the server, with the hostname
    and version of the server. This file exists *only* so that it can be used
    by appengine/swarming/tools/bot_archive.py; when the bot is generated by
    the server, the config in the yield_swarming_bot_files function in
    appengine/swarming/server/bot_archive.py is used instead.
