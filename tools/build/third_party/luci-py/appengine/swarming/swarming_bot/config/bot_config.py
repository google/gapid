"""This file is meant to be overriden by the server's specific copy.

You can upload a new version via /restricted/upload/bot_config.

There's 3 types of functions in this file:
  - get_*() to return properties to describe this bot.
  - on_*() as hooks based on events happening on the bot.
  - setup_*() to setup global state on the host.

This file shouldn't import from other scripts in this directory except
os_utilities which is guaranteed to be usable as an API. It's fine to import
from stdlib.

There can be two copies of this file. The base file and a bot specific version:
  - For get_*() functions, the bot specific version is called first,
    and if missing, the general version is called.
  - For on_*() functions, the hook in the general bot_config.py is called first,
    then the hook in the bot specific bot_config.py is called.
  - For setup_*(), the bot specific bot_config.py is never used.
