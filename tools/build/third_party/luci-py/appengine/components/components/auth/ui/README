Authentication management REST API and UI.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REST API is defined in rest_api.py module.

UI implemented as a client side Javascript application that uses REST API.

UI is structured as a set of tabs in a navigation bar, each tab is a separate
HTML page (see http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) served by some
handler defined ui.py module.

Each page has a javascript module associated with it that implements all UI
logic. Entry point in such module is 'onContentLoaded' function that is called
once main page body is loaded. Anatomy of a javascript module defined in
module_name.js:

var module_name = (function() {
var exports = {};

exports.symbol = ....

return exports;
}());

Code in base.html relies on correspondence of javascript file name and name of
a module object it exports.

Each module have access to several global objects (loaded in base.html)
provided by third party libraries:
 * $ - jQuery library, see static/third_party/jquery/.
 * _ - underscore library, see static/third_party/underscore/.
 * Handlebars - handlebars template library, see static/third_party/handlebars/.

Additional global objects are:
 * common - a module with utility functions, see common.js.
 * api - a module with wrappers around auth service REST API, see api.js.
 * config - an object with page configuration passed from python code,
      see UIHandler class ui.py module.
