Description:
This library is the preferred way of accessing Google Cloud Storage from
App Engine. It was designed to replace the Files API. As a result it contains
much of the functionality. (streaming reads and writes but not the complete
set of GCS APIs) It also provides key stability improvements and a better
overall developer experience.

Local Modifications:
Kept only src/cloudstorage/. Stripped test/ and demo/.
