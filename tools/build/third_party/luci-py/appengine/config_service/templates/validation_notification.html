<p>Hi {{ author }},</p>

<p>
  Some configs in revision <a href="{{ rev_link }}">{{ rev_hash }}</a>
  in {{ rev_repo }} repo have validation errors.
  <a href="{{ hostname }}">luci-config</a> had to reject all configs in this
  revision.
</p>

<ul>
  {% for msg in messages %}
    <li>{{ msg.severity }}: {{ msg.text }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>Please correct these errors. If you have questions, ask CCed people.</p>

<p>If a .proto file was updated recently, the service performing validation
of "invalid" file(s) may need to be redeployed.</p>

{% if cur_rev_hash %}
  <p>
    Configs in revision <a href="{{ cur_rev_link }}">{{ cur_rev_hash }}</a>
    will remain active until new valid ones are committed.
  </p>
{% endif %}

<p>-Your friendly luci-config service</p>
