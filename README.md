The [developer documentation](DEVDOC.md) contains some hints for GAPID
developers. See also the README files under some source directories.

## About

GAPID is a collection of tools that allows you to inspect, tweak and replay calls from an application to a graphics driver.

GAPID can trace any Android [debuggable application](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html#debug), or if you have root access to the device any application can be traced.
GAPID can also trace any desktop Vulkan application.

## Building

**See [Building GAPID](BUILDING.md).**

## Running the client

After building GAPID, you can run the client from `<gapid-root>/bazel-bin/pkg/gapid`.

## Project Structure

GAPID consists of the following sub-components:

### [`gapii`](gapii): Graphics API Interceptor
A layer that sits between the application / game and the GPU driver, recording all the calls and memory accesses.

### [`gapis`](gapis): Graphics API Server
A process that analyses capture streams reporting incorrect API usage, processes the data for replay on various target devices, and provides an RPC interface to the client.

### [`gapir`](gapir): Graphics API Replay daemon
A stack-based VM used to playback capture files, imitating the original applicationâ€™s / game's calls to the GPU driver. Supports read-back of any buffer / framebuffer, and provides profiling functionality.

### [`gapic`](gapic): Graphics API Client
The frontend user interface application. Provides visual inspection of the capture data, memory, resources, and frame-buffer content.

### [`gapil`](gapil): Graphics API Language
A new domain specific language to describe a graphics API in its entirety. Combined with our template system to generate huge parts of the interceptor, server and replay systems.
