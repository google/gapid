# GAPID: **G**raphics **API** **D**ebugger

GAPID is a collection of tools that allows you to inspect, tweak and replay calls from an application to a graphics driver.

## Status
GAPID is still in development but already can be used to debug many Android OpenGL ES and Vulkan applications.
Downloadable prebuilts will be available once the project reaches beta quality.
Vulkan is still a work in progress. Current status can be found [here](gapis/gfxapi/vulkan/README.md).

## Building
See [Building GAPID](BUILDING.md).

## Overview
GAPID consists of the following sub-components:

### [`gapii`](gapii): Graphics API Interceptor
A layer that sits between the application / game and the GPU driver, recording all the calls and memory accesses.

### [`gapis`](gapis): Graphics API Server
A process that analyses capture streams reporting incorrect API usage, processes the data for replay on various target devices, and provides an RPC interface to the client.

### [`gapir`](gapir): Graphics API Replay daemon
A stack-based VM used to playback capture files, imitating the original applicationâ€™s / game's calls to the GPU driver. Supports read-back of any buffer / framebuffer, and provides profiling functionality.

### [`gapic`](gapic): Graphics API Client
The frontend user interface application. Provides visual inspection of the capture data, memory, resources, and frame-buffer content.

### [`gapil`](gapil): Graphics API Language
A new domain specific language to describe a graphics API in its entirety. Combined with our template system to generate huge parts of the interceptor, server and replay systems.
