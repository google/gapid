The **Framebuffer** pane shows the contents of the currently bound framebuffer. Depending on the item you select in the **Commands** pane, it can show onscreen or offscreen framebuffers.

When you select a command in the **Commands** pane, the **Framebuffer** pane displays the contents of the framebuffer after that call finishes. If you select a group, it displays the framebuffer after the last call in that group finishes.

In essence, you can start by selecting the first call within a frame, and then click each successive call to watch the framebuffer components draw one-by-one until the end of the frame. These framebuffer displays, for both onscreen and offscreen graphics, help you to locate the source of any rendering errors.

If the framebuffer contains undefined data, you'll see diagonal bright green lines, as shown in figure 5.
